### Changes:
The following changes were made to the code:
1. Change the title so the tab says the company name
2. Change the padding in the header so there is less empty space in the header
3. Fix the position of the header so it is relative to the next block
4. Add the wrapper so the items don't move when the window is resized
5. Consolidated css tags that repeated formatting into classes
6. Rename divs with semantic tags
7. Add alt text to imgs
8. Reordered the css tags so they correspond to the order of the html
9. Created ids where appropriate
