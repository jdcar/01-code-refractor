Changes done:

1. Change the title so the tab says the company name
2. Change the padding in the header so there is less empty space in the header
3. Fix the position of the header so it is relative to the next block
4. Add the wrapper so the items don't move when the window is resized
5. Consolidated css tags that repeated formatting
6. Added semantic tags


Need to be done:
need the first link to jump down page to first box
